# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is iteration?

  Your answer: Iteration is repeating a defined process infinitely or until a condition is met. 

  Researched answer: Iteration is the process of performing a specific process until a specific number of times or until a condition evaluates to true. If the condition always evaluates to true without a defined number of times or limit to the iteration, the process will run infinitely. 



2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

  Your answer: The .map higher order function takes in the parameters of value, index, and length. The .map function is intended to work on arrays. Only one parameter is required, but it doesn't matter which one of the three. 

  Researched answer: The .map method takes in parameters of value, index, and length of an array. The value parameter is required and the index and length parameters are optional because the .map method is a higher order function iterates through an array to give an output of a new array and an array cannot exist without defined values. The index and length of the array will be deifined by the input values and number of elements input.  



3. What is object destructuring?

  Your answer: Object destructering is a method of taking individual key: value pairs out of an object as independent variables. 

  Researched answer: Object destructuring is a way to assign variables by taking the properties of an object and breaking them down into individual variables that can be recalled throughout the code as a faster way to manipulate objects and nested properties.



4. What is the difference between a function and a method?

  Your answer: A function should be universal and can be take various inputs such as defined variables outside of the function. Methods are built into the language of javascript to be used to perform a specific task on a specific or limited data type.

  Researched answer: Functions are blueprint for logic, that are reusable pieces of code that only execute when being called on by its name and that uses an input parameter to execute. Methods are associated with object data types, is invoked using the dot notation or square bracket notation, and operates on the data contained in a class. 



5. What is the difference between a class and an object?

  Your answer: A class is a blueprint of an object that can be called upon universally throughout the code, similarly how a function operates for logic. An object is a defined "object" data type that stores key: value pairs, stored and structured similar to an array. 

  Researched answer: A class is a blueprint of an object that is universal, reusable, and customizable. Each object created from a defined class is indpenedent from each other object that is created from that same defined class. 



6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

  Your answer: Hoisting is the act of defining a value/function/class to be referenced as universal thoughout the code. It can be set as a placeholder if the desired function/class hasn't been defined yet. 

  Researched answer: Did not strecth this week. 



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Class Inheritance: Creating a new class that inherits the attributes of a parent class.

2. React: A javascript library used to build web pages and mobile apps. 

3. React state: An object that stores a component's dynamic data and detrmines how it bhaves. 

4. React lifecycle methods: mounting, updating, and unmounting

5. DOM: Document Object Model in react, a structured representation of HTML elements that are on the page or app.
